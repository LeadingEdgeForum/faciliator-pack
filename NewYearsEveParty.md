# New Year's Eve Party Activity

## Executive Summary

The page below contains description, facilitator's guide and resources associated with a 'New Year's Eve Party' exercise, which is supposed to help workshop participants to gain confidence in their mapping knowledge and prepare a map in a business-neutral environment.

**Licence:** CC-BY-SA

**Intended Audience:** Wardley Mapping facilitators & trainers

**Activity duration:** 45-75 minutes. 


## Prerequisites
* Participants have to have a minimal understanding of Evolution and know how is the map built. 
The knowledge does not have to be very deep, 10-15 explanation of what a map is is usually sufficient.
* Participants must understand and accept the reason why they are doing the exercise, 
which is to practice Wardley Mapping in a safe environment before jumping into the problem they want to tackle with mapping.
* It is advised to showcase at least one example of a situation where mapping provided unexpected value. 
One of Simon's stories will do, but it is much better to have something personal and relevant for the audience. 
Some people may have heard about mapping and they may recognise it as an IT thing and categorise mapping not useful for them.
Asking people to not judge mapping before the workshop ends is advised.
* It is worth to have a business challenge identified at the beginning of the workshop and point out to it just before this exercise. 
'We are doing this exercise to get practical with Wardley Mapping, which provided [that value] in [the use case], 
and we hope you will get similar value out of it when you will apply mapping to your business challenge.
* Participants must be split into groups between 4 to 6 members. In larger groups, some people may not participate in the discussion. 
* Miro Board design should accomodate at least three major sections:
  * A board for a walkthrough
  * Boards for the breakout groups
  * A Panel for Q&A Session
* Example
